# DMD-Applications
Explore two dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) applications in this repository: 
1) Foreground and Background separation.
   You can run the matlab file by giving the input videos of your choice which are available in the above respective folders 
2) Characterization of chemical reactor mixing.
   You can run the python file by giving the input video beaker.mov which is available in the above respective folders.
